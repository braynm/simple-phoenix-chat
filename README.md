[Simple Phoenix Chat][1]
========================

Source code for the `Chatroom` phoenix app I built to show the working of channels
in the Phoenix Framework. Check out the [Blog Post][1]!


## Getting Started

To start the Phoenix app:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
